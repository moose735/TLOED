# üèà TLOED Fantasy Football App - Yearly Maintenance Guide

This guide outlines all the manual tasks you need to complete each year to keep your fantasy football app updated and functional.

## üìÖ Annual Tasks Checklist

> **üì¢ GOOD NEWS:** Your sportsbook spreads are now fully automated! No more manual weekly work needed.
> 
> **üì¢ CLEANUP NEEDED:** Google Sheets are no longer used - you can remove those URLs from config.js

### üèÜ 1. Update League ID (START OF SEASON)
**File:** `/src/config.js`
**Line:** `export const CURRENT_LEAGUE_ID = '1181984921049018368';`

**When:** At the beginning of each new season when Sleeper creates a new league
**Why:** Each year Sleeper creates a new league ID, even for continuing leagues
**How to find new League ID:**
1. Go to your league on Sleeper website
2. Look at the URL: `https://sleeper.app/leagues/[LEAGUE_ID]/`
3. Copy the league ID from the URL
4. Replace the old ID in config.js

```javascript
// Example update
export const CURRENT_LEAGUE_ID = '1234567890123456789'; // Replace with new year's league ID
```

### üèÜ 2. Add Champion Images (AFTER PLAYOFFS)
**Directory:** `/src/assets/images/hall-of-champions/`
**File to Update:** `/src/lib/HallOfChampions.js`

**When:** After your fantasy football playoffs conclude
**Steps:**
1. **Take/Find Champion Photo**
   - Get a celebration photo of the champion
   - Recommended size: 400x400px or larger
   - Formats: JPG, PNG
   - Name it: `YEAR-champion.jpg` (e.g., `2025-champion.jpg`)

2. **Add Image to Directory**
   - Save the image in `/src/assets/images/hall-of-champions/`

3. **Update HallOfChampions.js**
   - Find the `championImages` object (around line 110)
   - Add the new year's entry:
   ```javascript
   const championImages = {
       2025: require('../assets/images/hall-of-champions/2025-champion.jpg'),
       2024: require('../assets/images/hall-of-champions/2024-champion.JPG'),
       // ... existing years
   };
   ```

---

### üèÜ 3. Add League MVP (AFTER PLAYOFFS)
**File:** `/src/lib/HallOfChampions.js`
**Section:** `leagueMVPs` object (around line 25-80)

**When:** After playoffs, when you decide the League MVP
**Steps:**
1. **Find Player ID**
   - Use the "View Roster" button on champion cards to see player IDs
   - Or check browser console for `championPlayersByYear` object

2. **Add MVP Entry**
   ```javascript
   const leagueMVPs = {
       2025: { 
           playerId: '1234', 
           name: 'Player Name', 
           position: 'QB', 
           team: 'BUF', 
           reasonTitle: 'Why they were MVP'
           // staticHeadshot: require('../assets/images/mvp-headshots/2025-player-name-buf.jpg')
       },
       // ... existing years
   };
   ```

3. **Add Static MVP Headshot (RECOMMENDED)**
   - Save player headshot: `/src/assets/images/mvp-headshots/2025-player-name-team.jpg`
   - Uncomment and update the `staticHeadshot` line
   - This preserves the image even if player retires/changes teams

---

### üë• 4. Update Team Roster Changes (AS NEEDED)
**File:** `/src/config.js`
**Section:** `TEAM_NAME_TO_SLEEPER_ID_MAP`

**When:** When managers join/leave the league
**What to Update:**
```javascript
export const TEAM_NAME_TO_SLEEPER_ID_MAP = {
  'ManagerName': 'sleeper_user_id',
  // Add new managers, remove old ones
};

export const RETIRED_MANAGERS = new Set ([
  'old_sleeper_user_id_1',
  'old_sleeper_user_id_2',
  // Add IDs of managers who left
]);
```

---

### üìà 5. Clean Up Legacy Configuration (ONE-TIME CLEANUP)
**File:** `/src/config.js`
**Section:** Remove unused Google Sheets URLs

**When:** Next time you update the config
**What to Remove:**
```javascript
// These are NO LONGER USED - can be deleted:
export const GOOGLE_SHEET_POWER_RANKINGS_API_URL = '...';
export const HISTORICAL_MATCHUPS_API_URL = '...';
```

**Why:** Your app now uses Sleeper API directly - these Google Sheets URLs are legacy and no longer used.

4. **Backup your images** - Store copies outside the repo
5. **Document your changes** - Keep notes on what you changed each year
6. **Clean up legacy code** - Remove unused Google Sheets URLs from config.js

### üîç Testing Your Changes

1. Clear browser cache
2. Refresh the app
3. Check that new champion appears in Hall of Champions
4. Verify MVP displays correctly
5. Test that league data loads properly

### üìû Getting Help
If something breaks:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify League ID is correct and league exists
