# üèà TLOED Fantasy Football App - Yearly Maintenance Guide

This guide outlines all the manual tasks you need to complete each year to keep your fantasy football app updated and functional.

## üìÖ Annual Tasks Checklist

> **üì¢ GOOD NEWS:** Your sportsbook spreads are now fully automated! No more manual weekly work needed.
> 
> **üì¢ CLEANUP NEEDED:** Google Sheets are no longer used - you can remove those URLs from config.js

### üèÜ 1. Update League ID (START OF SEASON)
**File:** `/src/config.js`
**Line:** `export const CURRENT_LEAGUE_ID = '1181984921049018368';`

**When:** At the beginning of each new season when Sleeper creates a new league
**Why:** Each year Sleeper creates a new league ID, even for continuing leagues
**How to find new League ID:**
1. Go to your league on Sleeper website
2. Look at the URL: `https://sleeper.app/leagues/[LEAGUE_ID]/`
3. Copy the league ID from the URL
4. Replace the old ID in config.js

```javascript
// Example update
export const CURRENT_LEAGUE_ID = '1234567890123456789'; // Replace with new year's league ID
```

---

### üèÜ 2. Add Champion Images (AFTER PLAYOFFS)
**Directory:** `/src/assets/images/hall-of-champions/`
**File to Update:** `/src/lib/HallOfChampions.js`

**When:** After your fantasy football playoffs conclude
**Steps:**
1. **Take/Find Champion Photo**
   - Get a celebration photo of the champion
   - Recommended size: 400x400px or larger
   - Formats: JPG, PNG
   - Name it: `YEAR-champion.jpg` (e.g., `2025-champion.jpg`)

2. **Add Image to Directory**
   - Save the image in `/src/assets/images/hall-of-champions/`

3. **Update HallOfChampions.js**
   - Find the `championImages` object (around line 110)
   - Add the new year's entry:
   ```javascript
   const championImages = {
       2025: require('../assets/images/hall-of-champions/2025-champion.jpg'),
       2024: require('../assets/images/hall-of-champions/2024-champion.JPG'),
       // ... existing years
   };
   ```

---

### üèÜ 3. Add League MVP (AFTER PLAYOFFS)
**File:** `/src/lib/HallOfChampions.js`
**Section:** `leagueMVPs` object (around line 25-80)

**When:** After playoffs, when you decide the League MVP
**Steps:**
1. **Find Player ID**
   - Use the "View Roster" button on champion cards to see player IDs
   - Or check browser console for `championPlayersByYear` object

2. **Add MVP Entry**
   ```javascript
   const leagueMVPs = {
       2025: { 
           playerId: '1234', 
           name: 'Player Name', 
           position: 'QB', 
           team: 'BUF', 
           reasonTitle: 'Why they were MVP'
           // staticHeadshot: require('../assets/images/mvp-headshots/2025-player-name-buf.jpg')
       },
       // ... existing years
   };
   ```

3. **Add Static MVP Headshot (RECOMMENDED)**
   - Save player headshot: `/src/assets/images/mvp-headshots/2025-player-name-team.jpg`
   - Uncomment and update the `staticHeadshot` line
   - This preserves the image even if player retires/changes teams

---

### üë• 4. Update Team Roster Changes (AS NEEDED)
**File:** `/src/config.js`
**Section:** `TEAM_NAME_TO_SLEEPER_ID_MAP`

**When:** When managers join/leave the league
**What to Update:**
```javascript
export const TEAM_NAME_TO_SLEEPER_ID_MAP = {
  'ManagerName': 'sleeper_user_id',
  // Add new managers, remove old ones
};

export const RETIRED_MANAGERS = new Set ([
  'old_sleeper_user_id_1',
  'old_sleeper_user_id_2',
  // Add IDs of managers who left
]);
```

---

### üìà 5. Clean Up Legacy Configuration (ONE-TIME CLEANUP)
**File:** `/src/config.js`
**Section:** Remove unused Google Sheets URLs

**When:** Next time you update the config
**What to Remove:**
```javascript
// These are NO LONGER USED - can be deleted:
export const GOOGLE_SHEET_POWER_RANKINGS_API_URL = '...';
export const HISTORICAL_MATCHUPS_API_URL = '...';
```

**Why:** Your app now uses Sleeper API directly - these Google Sheets URLs are legacy and no longer used.

---

### üé∞ 6. Sportsbook Spreads (FULLY AUTOMATED ‚úÖ)
**Status:** No manual work required!

**What's Automated:**
- Spread calculations based on team performance
- Power rankings and ELO ratings

- All betting markets generate automatically

**Files That Handle This:**
- `/src/utils/cleanOddsCalculator.js` - Main calculation engine
- `/src/components/Sportsbook.js` - UI display
- `/src/utils/matchupOdds.js` - Win probability calculations

**You Don't Need To:**
- ‚ùå Manually update spreads weekly
- ‚ùå Run analysis scripts
- ‚ùå Update hardcoded matchup expectations

**The System Automatically:**
- ‚úÖ Calculates spreads based on team stats
- ‚úÖ Updates win probabilities in real-time
- ‚úÖ Generates betting markets from Sleeper data
- ‚úÖ Adjusts for recent performance and trends

## üîß Optional Advanced Tasks

### üèÜ Champion Image Organization
Create organized subdirectories:
```
/src/assets/images/hall-of-champions/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-champion.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2024-champion.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ celebration-photos/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ trophy-photos/
```

### üì∏ Automated Image Processing
Consider adding image optimization for:
- Champion photos
- MVP headshots
- Team logos

### üìä Historical Data Backup
**Recommended:** Regularly backup:
- `/src/config.js` - Your configuration
- `/src/assets/images/` - All your custom images
- Google Sheets data

---

## üö® Critical Reminders

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't Forget These!
1. **League ID is the #1 priority** - App won't work without correct current league ID
2. **Test after League ID change** - Verify data loads correctly
3. **MVP images should be added ASAP** - Before players retire or change teams
4. **Backup your images** - Store copies outside the repo
5. **Document your changes** - Keep notes on what you changed each year
6. **Clean up legacy code** - Remove unused Google Sheets URLs from config.js

### üîç Testing Your Changes
After making updates:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Refresh the app
3. Check that new champion appears in Hall of Champions
4. Verify MVP displays correctly
5. Test that league data loads properly

### üìû Getting Help
If something breaks:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify League ID is correct and league exists
3. Ensure image paths are correct
4. Check that all require() statements work
5. **Remember:** Sportsbook spreads are automated - no manual fixes needed!

### üïí Dashboard Countdowns (Trade Deadline & Draft)

Preferred workflow ‚Äî keep dates in `src/config.js` (DST-safe)

The Dashboard now reads two canonical ISO timestamps from `src/config.js`:

- `TRADE_DEADLINE_ISO`
- `DRAFT_DATE_ISO`

Why this approach:
- Explicit ISO timestamps that include a timezone offset (for example `-05:00` or `-04:00`) remove DST ambiguity and guarantee the client will interpret the exact intended instant.
- Centralizing the values in `src/config.js` makes yearly maintenance a single-file change.

Add or update these exports in `src/config.js` (examples):

```javascript
// Trade deadline (example: Nov 10, 2025 at 8:15pm Eastern Standard Time)
export const TRADE_DEADLINE_ISO = '2025-11-10T20:15:00-05:00'; // EST (UTC-5)

// Draft date (example: Sep 5, 2026 at 6:00pm Eastern Daylight Time)
export const DRAFT_DATE_ISO = '2026-09-05T18:00:00-04:00'; // EDT (UTC-4)
```

Notes on offsets:
- Use `-05:00` for Eastern Standard Time (typically Nov through Mar).
- Use `-04:00` for Eastern Daylight Time (typically Mar through Nov).
- If you're unsure which offset applies for a specific date, look up the local offset for that date or use a trusted timezone-aware calendar to confirm. Explicit offsets are the simplest and most reliable option.

What the Dashboard expects (current implementation):

```js
import { TRADE_DEADLINE_ISO, DRAFT_DATE_ISO } from '../config';

const TRADE_DEADLINE = useMemo(() => (TRADE_DEADLINE_ISO ? new Date(TRADE_DEADLINE_ISO) : null), [TRADE_DEADLINE_ISO]);
const DRAFT_DATE = useMemo(() => (DRAFT_DATE_ISO ? new Date(DRAFT_DATE_ISO) : null), [DRAFT_DATE_ISO]);
```

How to test after updating `src/config.js`:
1. Restart the dev server if it's running (`npm start`) so the updated config is picked up.
2. Open `http://localhost:3000/` and navigate to the Dashboard.
3. Confirm the two countdown badges appear above the weekly matchup ticker and show the expected remaining time.
4. Quick console sanity check in the browser console:

```javascript
// In the Dashboard page console
console.log('Trade deadline (local):', new Date(TRADE_DEADLINE_ISO).toString());
console.log('Draft date (local):', new Date(DRAFT_DATE_ISO).toString());
```

5. Verify behavior:
   - If the date is in the past the badge will show `Passed`.
   - Boxes should remain stable while ticking (tabular digits used).
   - On narrow screens the badges wrap and do not overflow.

Rollback (config edits):
- `git checkout -- src/config.js`

Optional automation ideas:
- If you prefer to avoid yearly edits entirely, we can add an admin UI or source these dates from a small JSON file or an external admin service.
