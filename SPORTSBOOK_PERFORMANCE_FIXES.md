# Sportsbook Performance Optimizations

## Issue Resolved
The sportsbook was experiencing severe performance issues with repeated expensive DPR calculations causing console spam and application slowdown.

## Performance Fixes Implemented

### 1. **DPR Calculation Caching**
- Added intelligent caching system for `calculateTeamDPRValues()`
- Cache key based on season and NFL week: `${currentSeason}-${currentWeek}`
- Cache TTL: 30 seconds to prevent excessive recalculation
- Prevents `calculateAllLeagueMetrics()` from running multiple times per page load

### 2. **Reduced Simulation Counts**
- Championship odds simulations: **5000 → 1000** (80% reduction)
- Playoff probability simulations: **5000 → 1000** (80% reduction) 
- Hybrid playoff calculations: **5000 → 1000** (80% reduction)
- Still provides accurate results with much faster performance

### 3. **Debug Log Removal**
- Removed verbose console logging from `calculations.js`
- Eliminated the spam of team award flag logs that were flooding the console
- Kept essential logging for DPR cache operations

### 4. **Error Handling & Fallbacks**
- Added try-catch blocks around DPR calculations
- Graceful degradation: if DPR fails, falls back to basic team stats
- Prevents one calculation failure from breaking entire sportsbook

### 5. **Cache Management**
- `clearDPRCache()` function for manual cache invalidation
- Automatic cache expiration based on time and context
- Smart cache key generation prevents stale data

## Technical Implementation

### Cache Structure
```javascript
let dprCache = {
    data: {},           // Calculated DPR values
    timestamp: null,    // When cache was created
    season: null,       // Season for validation
    cacheKey: null     // Composite key: "${season}-${week}"
};
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Before**: Multiple `calculateAllLeagueMetrics()` calls per page load
- **After**: Single calculation cached for 30 seconds
- **Simulation Reduction**: 80% fewer Monte Carlo runs
- **Console Spam**: Eliminated repetitive debug logs

### Cache Strategy
1. Check if cache exists and is valid (same season/week, under 30 seconds old)
2. If valid, return cached data immediately
3. If invalid, recalculate and update cache
4. Log cache operations for debugging

## Expected Performance Improvements
- **Faster Page Loads**: Elimination of redundant calculations
- **Smoother UI**: No more hanging during odds generation
- **Reduced Console Noise**: Clean logging output
- **Better UX**: Responsive sportsbook interactions

## Fallback Behavior
If DPR calculation fails or times out:
- System automatically falls back to basic team statistics
- Spreads still generated using average scores and win percentages
- No functionality loss, just reduced sophistication in early-season variance handling

This ensures the sportsbook remains functional even under high load or data issues.
