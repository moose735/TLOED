console.log('1. Algorithm calculates aggressive spreads based on pure statistics');
console.log('2. UI shows much more conservative spreads');
console.log('3. Gap suggests additional adjustment/capping is happening');

console.log('- Maximum spread caps (preventing huge spreads)');
console.log('- Betting balance adjustments');  
console.log('- Market maker conservative factors');
